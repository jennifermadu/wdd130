        Hello everyone! I'm Jennifer from Nigeria and am really excited to be in this class with you guys.
         I'm a returned missionary and I served at Nigeria Owerri Mission. I'm currently working as a Wealth Advisor 
         in the Real Estate Industry. I love learning new things and I find joy in coding, looking forward to 
         perfecting the coding skill. </p>
